Our faces get wet & everyone just wipes their faces constantly & handles food boxes. \nIt’s...it’s for our health. \n\nI’d LOVE for the person who decided this rule to spend 10 hours doing the job. There’s literally no reason to wear a mask if you’re 3ft away from anyone. We are obligated at all times even if you’re 100ft away.",

    "text": " @Mike_M  I put on one of their masks right before entering the Emergency doors and a mask cop within 3 walking seconds told me to take mine off and put on their [identical] one. So I argued with them about how and why that was stupid (and environmentally unfriendly). So they had 2 security guards come over and almost touch me to bring me to their office to potentially get the cops to arrest me. I then pulled out my softgun scary looking (skullish) half head mask and put it on. The guards and the bully nurse (who got angry then) told me to take that off and put on their mask. I then argued that this was more effective than both and wasn't detrimental to my health. They said that I wasn't allowed to wear it since it scares people. Well, because I had a diabetes appointment (due to COVID lockdowns giving me the disease) to replenish my insulin supplies that I was out of, I chose to save my own life and put their mask on, but not without arguing more then and when I later left.",

    "text": "We are living in a new form of state government: the MEDICAL DICTATORSHIP.\nNo matter excisting laws or constitution: 'everything' has to go for this 'medical emergency' that has been plaging us for OVER A YEAR now. \nThe 'medical emergency' is not going away. In the mean time: 'some docs' (who are all in league with the globalists) take away our rights like they never existed. We: are living in a MEDICAL DICTATORSHIP. \n\nThis is not just hyperbolic talk: lets focus on one example: the Dutch have, in their constitution, the right to demonstrate (art 9): 'Het recht tot vergadering en betoging wordt erkend, behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet.' (the right to gather and protest is recognized, as long as it follows the law' (aka no violence etc). It also has a b-clause: 'De wet kan regels stellen ter bescherming van de gezondheid, in het belang van het verkeer en ter bestrijding of voorkoming van wanordelijkheden.' which states that to prevent chaos in traffic, riots, or TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, the state is allowed to make rules. \n\nSo, they used this 'medical emergency' to declare a state of emergency: and say: 'listen, NO protesting, ok? covid you know!' for the first 2 weeks. And then the 3rd week. And fourth. Etc. So now: in year 2 of this medical emergency: we realize: we are NEVER going to get back this right to protest: covid: WILL ALWAYS be around. \n\nSo, artikel 9 of our constitution is now worth more as toilet paper then as 'giver of rights'. We DONT have the right to protest: ANYMORE. Why? \"MEDICAL DICTATORSHIP\" trumps democracy!?!    Covid measures destroy EVERYTHING. Economy: social cohesion, culture, E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G is destroyed by the medics 'to stop covid'. EVERYTHING.",

Graphene is an incredible material that has the potential to be - when we manage to manufacture long chains of it - the strongest, lightest material ever made.  It has the potential to make building materials that are 1000+ times as strong as carbon fiber for the same weight.  It could make \"space elevators\" possible one day.   But we can't make it in long chains yet, only in tiny particles that can be easily lifted by air currents. These particles can enter your lungs and have no way of being flushed out.  It's like asbestos squared.  It's insane that they included loose graphene in any medical device.",

You're putting a filthy napkin on your face for hours at a time.  Nothing about that is good for you or anyone around you.  You're a worse spreader of just about everything with that filthy garbage on your face than with nothing.  Keep in mind, throwing those reusable masks in your washing machine doesn't sanitize them.  They need to be washed in industrial washers using specific cleaning products in order to sanitize them between uses.  And even then most people put their hands all over them right away anyways.  Before this insane charade hospital workers didn't even ware masks unless they were worried about things like a patient coughing blood into their mouths or something similar. Not if they were treating someone with the flu for instance.  And those masks would be put on immediately before seeing the patient and discarded immediately when they finish.  Not worn in perpetuity for hours at a time, being taken off and put back on. In surgeries they're in sterile environments and again they put them on right before going in and remove them when they're leaving.",

And in the lawyers office when she photocopied my ID. Other than that, won't wear them, and avoid any place where you have to. But my son wears them.  We have to take our world back. Coast to Coast councils of citizens that think tank and come up with assertive actions, from millions writing/phoning in and shocking politicians and police chiefs and bad judges, to general strikes if people show numbers, majority type numbers.  I don't understand what is going on. You never follow bad orders, all things that violate conscience are crimes and Null and Void. Nuremburg Trials, had to write a 2000 word essay on it and never forgot that bad laws aren't legal, they are actual crimes. In fact, they considered the documents the fascists created automatic crimes, and their signatures confessions. People need to overcome fear and take stands against tyranny.",

    "text": "The masks are BS in general. Does anyone really believe masks with gapping sides and porous material would protect against tiny particles? Besides the fact that people are not meant to wear masks on their faces all the time. I wonder if trapping all that moisture will cause a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses? Now, there are toxic masks, which will cause lung damage, which allegedly help prevent lung damage?? It is so nuts, you can't make this stuff up! Besides, the only mask that even does a little is an N95. Never trust a government to give a damn about you or your family. Citizens are a resource for all governments and when there are too many, they become a burden.  I feel bad for children this is all so damaging. I am not shocked by any of this. I heard about the toxics masks, but not from you. Anything made in China is likely to be toxic. They do many dirty things to circumvent laws. I worked in food policy, so I would know.",

I read that these graphene particles were moleculary similar to asbestos and exposed the wearer to similar risk. But don't get me started on the failure of OSHA to push back against the one-size-fits-all model of mandating PPE in the workplace without the prerequisite protocols in place then and now. My soul weeps for the poor folks, like the staff at the Tim Horton's where I get my coffee on the way to my essential work every morning, forced to spend their entire shift wearing a snot bag. I said to anyone who would listen last year that when snot bags became a fashion statement we as a culture were done - and the speed with which that actually happened (promoted in fact by the CBC) was truly astonishing. Spoke with one of my employees just yesterday - she has been faithfully wearing her mask even while alone, due to the fear mongering, for the past year and just had 4 teeth pulled due to gum disease when she had never even been to a dentist for the prior 4 decades of her life. Here in Ontario we're entering the third \"emergency\" stand down (because the first two worked so well, I guess) and I've realized that this whole thing is beyond stupidity, incompetence, or mere negligence - it is intentional. When we had stunt drivers light a parking lot on fire with gasoline the other day, so they could do donuts for YouTube, and then attack the police who responded - only to flee and do the same thing twice at different locations later that eve - our response from Toronto mayor John Tory was: (paraphrasing) You see? This is why we need to lockdown the province again. Bad behaviour like this spreads the virus and we must protect everyone for their own good...\n\nI can accept stupidity and incompetence - when it is recognised and rectified - so this is simply the intentional implementation of a preconceived agenda, which they actually admit to if you listen to what they say...",

That wouldn't be the 'friend' of idiot boy TrueJoke that didn't have a PPE manufacturing company but was given 237 million dollars to 'produce' masks was it?  This story had been exposed some 8 to 9 months ago but it was a 'TrueJoke' thing that we in the west could only grind our teeth over.  My only happy thought is the masks were likely coveted by the Quebec minions of TrueJoke and lavished on ONLY Quebecors and now its blowing up in Quebec's faces. I feel bad for the children but as to the adults that have watched TrueJoke decimate Alberta and Saskatchewan since 'socks' was vote in - BIG DEEP BREATHS.  No longer care about your rant - perhaps some of the last 13 billion dollars raped out of Alberta's red tape strangled industries each year will help the pain go away.  #AlbertaAndSaskatchewanWillLeaveThisShtholeCountryCanada",

Repeating this heating process every  10 minutes.  Today, he likes to nibble at my boots while I'm wearing them. And its been 5 months since he was that cold, unresponsive baby in the slush and snow.  Needless to say, he's much bigger now than he was then)",

Government pretty much labels anything that hasn't gone through incredible testing to be dangerous, I'm pretty shocked that they haven't outlawed t-shirt masks because 10 years of studies haven't been done on whether they're safe.  As far as being \"unfit\" I don't think masks make a difference.  During the Spanish flu everyone wore masks and it didn't help.",

So the dems/deep state sold us out to the CCP again. Pfizer has many shady dealings with them. The CCP wants us locked up, muzzled, tracked and defenseless.\r\nFACT: the masks we wear are virus collectors\r\nThe hospitals are a business and a corrupt one as well. China got us to do it to ourselves. Back up the last video it's important for our freedom. And print the pdf\r\nI have to take a TB test for a work physical. TB kills 1.4 million people a year. Zaire ebolavirus genus has an almost 100% kill rate, only a handful of people survive. Hospitals are inflating the numbers. They get 36,000 to 48,000 dollars per virus case. They say no visitors to stop the spread. Bullsh!t, that translates to no witnesses and no more malpractice suits. South Dakota is doing just fine, so is Florida. If the hospital does the right thing, we have great treatments. The ventilators can cause pneumonia and you can become dependant on oxygen. The vaccine has a tracking device in it and enough antibodies to drop a horse.\r\nFrontline Doctors PDF\nhttps://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/99d35b02-a5cb-41e6-ad80-a070f8a5ee17/JonasSalkPetition_VaccinePP%20.pdf\n\r\n\r\nBevelyn Beatty, a great woman of GOD, was stabbed in DC\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/1741279/proud-boys-conservative-activist-bevelyn-beatty-stabbed/\r\nHer nightmare at the hospital\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VcMQgxg5M&t=2s\r\nAfter her followers raised hell\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2Ncy_Jgcs&t=2s\r\nThe hospital could have killed her and then told the family that she died from the virus. Because of her work, she was invited to the frontline doctors summit meeting and posted the PDF\r\nThink about this: if this virus is so deadly; why aren't dumptrucks picking up dead homeless people all day every day? They eat out of dumpsters, co-mingle with each other, stay in homeless shelters and go into restaurants asking for food. Their health is worse than many of ours. We have to get out and become immune to it. Almost all of us will get a mild form, or nothing at all, but this is to become immune to this.. But if you are worried about it, you also have to be worried about TB and Ebola and the regular flu.\r\nWhistleblowers are coming out. I been getting a disinfectant spray comparable to Lysol since 2018. That spray has always said, kills covid.\r\nA clinitian told me that's it's obscene that they have to write died by the virus on all the death certificates\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWVbjsfSHK4&list=PLUpt0Ez5VMn53wzD9Ln0szUodweJpq6tT&index=2&t=1s\r\nA retired VA hospital administrator told me they've known this all along.\r\nThe CCP is in charge and in bed with many.\r\nStockpile, ACT, PRAY and buy literature you find important in a hard copy.",

It would serve them right if the PPE sent to them by the Canadian government at the beginning of this nonsense was made by China.",

So the dems/deep state sold us out to the CCP again. Pfizer has many shady dealings with them. The CCP wants us locked up, muzzled, tracked and defenseless.\r\nFACT: the masks we wear are virus collectors\r\nThe hospitals are a business and a corrupt one as well. China got us to do it to ourselves. Back up the last video it's important for our freedom. And print the pdf\r\nI have to take a TB test for a work physical. TB kills 1.4 million people a year. Zaire ebolavirus genus has an almost 100% kill rate, only a handful of people survive. Hospitals are inflating the numbers. They get 36,000 to 48,000 dollars per virus case. They say no visitors to stop the spread. Bullsh!t, that translates to no witnesses and no more malpractice suits. South Dakota is doing just fine, so is Florida. If the hospital does the right thing, we have great treatments. The ventilators can cause pneumonia and you can become dependant on oxygen. The vaccine has a tracking device in it and enough antibodies to drop a horse.\r\nFrontline Doctors PDF\nhttps://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/99d35b02-a5cb-41e6-ad80-a070f8a5ee17/JonasSalkPetition_VaccinePP%20.pdf\n\r\n\r\nBevelyn Beatty, a great woman of GOD, was stabbed in DC\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/1741279/proud-boys-conservative-activist-bevelyn-beatty-stabbed/\r\nHer nightmare at the hospital\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VcMQgxg5M&t=2s\r\nAfter her followers raised hell\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2Ncy_Jgcs&t=2s\r\nThe hospital could have killed her and then told the family that she died from the virus. Because of her work, she was invited to the frontline doctors summit meeting and posted the PDF\r\nThink about this: if this virus is so deadly; why aren't dumptrucks picking up dead homeless people all day every day? They eat out of dumpsters, co-mingle with each other, stay in homeless shelters and go into restaurants asking for food. Their health is worse than many of ours. We have to get out and become immune to it. Almost all of us will get a mild form, or nothing at all, but this is to become immune to this.. But if you are worried about it, you also have to be worried about TB and Ebola and the regular flu.\r\nWhistleblowers are coming out. I been getting a disinfectant spray comparable to Lysol since 2018. That spray has always said, kills covid.\r\nA clinitian told me that's it's obscene that they have to write died by the virus on all the death certificates\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWVbjsfSHK4&list=PLUpt0Ez5VMn53wzD9Ln0szUodweJpq6tT&index=2&t=1s\r\nA retired VA hospital administrator told me they've known this all along.\r\nThe CCP is in charge and in bed with many.\r\nStockpile, ACT, PRAY and buy literature you find important in a hard copy. Try to get to a state that follows the constitution",

    "text": "The CEO's of msm were taken to China and wined and dined. That's why they are training their audience for communism.  Warp Speed had no regulations on it. So the dems/deep state sold us out to the CCP again. Pfizer has many shady dealings with them. The CCP wants us locked up, muzzled, tracked and defenseless.\r\nFACT: the masks we wear are virus collectors\r\nThe hospitals are a business and a corrupt one as well. China got us to do it to ourselves. Back up the last video it's important for our freedom. And print the pdf\r\nI have to take a TB test for a work physical. TB kills 1.4 million people a year. Zaire ebolavirus genus has an almost 100% kill rate, only a handful of people survive. Hospitals are inflating the numbers. They get 36,000 to 48,000 dollars per virus case. They say no visitors to stop the spread. Bullsh!t, that translates to no witnesses and no more malpractice suits. South Dakota is doing just fine, so is Florida. If the hospital does the right thing, we have great treatments. The ventilators can cause pneumonia and you can become dependant on oxygen. The vaccine has a tracking device in it and enough antibodies to drop a horse.\r\nFrontline Doctors PDF\nhttps://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/99d35b02-a5cb-41e6-ad80-a070f8a5ee17/JonasSalkPetition_VaccinePP%20.pdf\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBevelyn Beatty, a great woman of GOD, was stabbed in DC\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/1741279/proud-boys-conservative-activist-bevelyn-beatty-stabbed/\r\nHer nightmare at the hospital\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VcMQgxg5M&t=2s\r\nAfter her followers raised hell\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2Ncy_Jgcs&t=2s\r\nThe hospital could have killed her and then told the family that she died from the virus. Because of her work, she was invited to the frontline doctors summit meeting and posted the PDF\r\nThink about this: if this virus is so deadly; why aren't dumptrucks picking up dead homeless people all day every day? They eat out of dumpsters, co-mingle with each other, stay in homeless shelters and go into restaurants asking for food. Their health is worse than many of ours. We have to get out and become immune to it. Almost all of us will get a mild form, or nothing at all, but this is to become immune to this.. But if you are worried about it, you also have to be worried about TB and Ebola and the regular flu.\r\nWhistleblowers are coming out. I been getting a disinfectant spray comparable to Lysol since 2018. That spray has always said, kills covid.\r\nA clinitian told me that's it's obscene that they have to write died by the virus on all the death certificates\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWVbjsfSHK4&list=PLUpt0Ez5VMn53wzD9Ln0szUodweJpq6tT&index=2&t=1s\r\nA retired VA hospital administrator told me they've known this all along.\r\nThe CCP is in charge and in bed with many.\r\nStockpile, ACT, PRAY and buy literature you find important in a hard copy. Try to get to a state that follows the constitution.",

We have taken every Step in our Power, consistent with the just Rights of the Freemen of Pennsylvania, for their Relief, and we have Reason to believe, that in the Midst of their Distresses they themselves do not wish us to go farther. Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.9 Such as were inclined to defend themselves, but unable to purchase Arms and Ammunition, have, as we are informed, been supplied with both, as far as Arms could be procured, out of Monies given by the last Assembly for the King’s Use; and the large Supply of Money offered by this Bill, might enable the Governor to do every Thing else that should be judged necessary for their farther Security, if he shall think fit to accept it. Whether he could, as he supposes, “if his Hands had been properly strengthened, have put the Province into such a Posture of Defence, as might have prevented the present Mischiefs,” seems to us uncertain; since late Experience in our neighbouring Colony of Virginia (which had every Advantage for that Purpose that could be desired) shows clearly, that it is next to impossible to guard effectually an extended Frontier, settled by scattered single Families at two or three Miles Distance, so as to secure them from the insiduous Attacks of small Parties of skulking Murderers: But thus much is certain, that by refusing our Bills from Time to Time, by which great Sums were seasonably offered, he has rejected all the Strength that Money could afford him; and if his Hands are still weak or unable, he ought only to blame himself, or those who have tied them.\r\n\r\nIf the Governor proceeds on his Journey,1 and takes a Quorum of his Council with him, we hope, since he retains our Bill, that it will be seriously and duly considered by them; and that the same Regard for the Publick Welfare which induced them unanimously to advise his intended Journey, will induce them as unanimously to advise his Assent. We agree therefore to his keeping the Bill, earnestly requesting he would re-consider it attentively; and shall be ready at any Time to meet him for the Purpose of enacting it into a Law.",

So the dems/deep state sold us out to the CCP again. Pfizer has many shady dealings with them. The CCP wants us locked up, muzzled, tracked and defenseless.\r\nFACT: the masks we wear are virus collectors\r\nThe hospitals are a business and a corrupt one as well. China got us to do it to ourselves. Back up the last video it's important for our freedom. And print the pdf\r\nI have to take a TB test for a work physical. TB kills 1.4 million people a year. Zaire ebolavirus genus has an almost 100% kill rate, only a handful of people survive. Hospitals are inflating the numbers. They get 36,000 to 48,000 dollars per virus case. They say no visitors to stop the spread. Bullsh!t, that translates to no witnesses and no more malpractice suits. South Dakota is doing just fine, so is Florida. If the hospital does the right thing, we have great treatments. The ventilators can cause pneumonia and you can become dependant on oxygen. The vaccine has a tracking device in it and enough antibodies to drop a horse.\r\nFrontline Doctors PDF\nhttps://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/99d35b02-a5cb-41e6-ad80-a070f8a5ee17/JonasSalkPetition_VaccinePP%20.pdf\n\r\n\r\nBevelyn Beatty, a great woman of GOD, was stabbed in DC\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/1741279/proud-boys-conservative-activist-bevelyn-beatty-stabbed/\r\nHer nightmare at the hospital\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VcMQgxg5M&t=2s\r\nAfter her followers raised hell\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2Ncy_Jgcs&t=2s\r\nThe hospital could have killed her and then told the family that she died from the virus. Because of her work, she was invited to the frontline doctors summit meeting and posted the PDF\r\nThink about this: if this virus is so deadly; why aren't dumptrucks picking up dead homeless people all day every day? They eat out of dumpsters, co-mingle with each other, stay in homeless shelters and go into restaurants asking for food. Their health is worse than many of ours. We have to get out and become immune to it. Almost all of us will get a mild form, or nothing at all, but this is to become immune to this.. But if you are worried about it, you also have to be worried about TB and Ebola and the regular flu.\r\nWhistleblowers are coming out. I been getting a disinfectant spray comparable to Lysol since 2018. That spray has always said, kills covid.\r\nA clinitian told me that's it's obscene that they have to write died by the virus on all the death certificates\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWVbjsfSHK4&list=PLUpt0Ez5VMn53wzD9Ln0szUodweJpq6tT&index=2&t=1s\r\nA retired VA hospital administrator told me they've known this all along.\r\nThe CCP is in charge and in bed with many.\r\nStockpile, ACT, PRAY and buy literature you find important in a hard copy.",

I can even cite you published papers that allow us to determine factors by proxy like the size of moisture droplets in human breath, the size of the virus, and the filtration rating and ratios for the different types of masks. \n\nSo please, if you think you got what it takes after reading a comic book or whatever,  bring it.

Anyone watching this early on saw the strange absurdities. For example anyone remember the Japanese dr who spoke out about how badly the stranded cruise ship in Japan was being handled? Or remember how Americans were flown out on a private jet and put in gov quarantine, similar to other foreign nationals on the cruise yet the Japanese nationals were let off and allowed to take public buses and transportation to get home. Someone or a group of someones with a lot of power wanted this to spread. Then it turned out not be as deadly so they went full on with using the media to alter reality",

    "text": "The CEO's of msm were taken to China and wined and dined. That's why they are training their audience for communism. And the CCP has some damning evidence on puppet joe, found on Hunter's laptop. Warp Speed had no regulations on it. So the dems/deep state sold us out to the CCP again. Pfizer has many shady dealings with them. The CCP wants us locked up, muzzled, tracked and defenseless.\r\nFACT: the masks we wear are virus collectors\r\nThe hospitals are a business and a corrupt one as well. China got us to do it to ourselves. Back up the last video it's important for our freedom. And print the pdf\r\nI have to take a TB test for a work physical. TB kills 1.4 million people a year. Zaire ebolavirus genus has an almost 100% kill rate, only a handful of people survive. Hospitals are inflating the numbers. They get 36,000 to 48,000 dollars per virus case. They say no visitors to stop the spread. Bullsh!t, that translates to no witnesses and no more malpractice suits. South Dakota is doing just fine, so is Florida. If the hospital does the right thing, we have great treatments. The ventilators can cause pneumonia and you can become dependant on oxygen. The vaccine has a tracking device in it and enough antibodies to drop a horse.\r\nFrontline Doctors PDF\nhttps://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/99d35b02-a5cb-41e6-ad80-a070f8a5ee17/JonasSalkPetition_VaccinePP%20.pdf\nBevelyn Beatty, a great woman of GOD, was stabbed in DC\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/1741279/proud-boys-conservative-activist-bevelyn-beatty-stabbed/\r\nHer nightmare at the hospital\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VcMQgxg5M&t=2s\r\nAfter her followers raised hell\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2Ncy_Jgcs&t=2s\r\nThe hospital could have killed her and then told the family that she died from the virus. Because of her work, she was invited to the frontline doctors summit meeting and posted the PDF\r\nThink about this: if this virus is so deadly; why aren't dumptrucks picking up dead homeless people all day every day? They eat out of dumpsters, co-mingle with each other, stay in homeless shelters and go into restaurants asking for food. Their health is worse than many of ours. We have to get out and become immune to it. Almost all of us will get a mild form, or nothing at all, but this is to become immune to this.. But if you are worried about it, you also have to be worried about TB and Ebola and the regular flu.\r\nWhistleblowers are coming out. I been getting a disinfectant spray comparable to Lysol since 2018. That spray has always said, kills covid.\r\nA clinitian told me that's it's obscene that they have to write died by the virus on all the death certificates\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWVbjsfSHK4&list=PLUpt0Ez5VMn53wzD9Ln0szUodweJpq6tT&index=2&t=1s\r\nA retired VA hospital administrator told me they've known this all along.\r\nThe CCP is in charge and in bed with many.\r\nStockpile, ACT, PRAY and buy literature you find important in a hard copy. Try to get to a state that follows the constitution",
