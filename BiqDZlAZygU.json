My stance is you should be able to say what you want no matter how offensive you may find it otherwise its not free its limited speech. My examples were Galileo saying the Earth revolves around the sun, saying god is not real, transsexual women are not women, evolution is true not creation. All of those cause offence but should people be stopped from saying them? To which i was given so someone should be able to say \"i hate black people\" I responded yes but he refused to listen to any justification.  I dont agree with some one saying it, i dont support the statement personally and i would encourage him to justify that statement but i support the rite for that person to state his belief because if you say he cant say what he feels then its just a slope into censorship as more gets added and you end up like china and the middle east.

The countries were ruled by the desires of like only 3% of the population but common people were generally content (ignorance is bliss) it wasn't until common people were educated for the good of the ruling class that they started to get ideas and be discontent with how representation worked. Lets face it even today about 30% or more (depending on region) of the population that are registered voters don't care enough about politics to actually bother to cast their vote. Northern Ireland is the worst turn out region in the entire UK something like 40% don't vote. If you don't vote you can't be angry when MPs do something you don't like. \n\nIf Scotland wants to truly become independent I will support them I just want them to remember a few things. One they currently publicly spend £2000 per person more than they take-in in taxes those figures are from the Scottish government not Westminster. Two that England/UK gave the EU decades of warnings that reforms were needed and that we weren't happy before we left the EU. The UK did try to reform the EU from the inside even many remainers recognised that there are legitimate problems with how the EU works that's why there are anti EU movements in most EU countries.

{"cid": "Ugyk5dJQPm1zKIP65WJ4AaABAg", "text": "The phrases Anti Vaxxer or Conspiracy Theorists are aimed at almost anyone who questions the narrative of governments or mainstream news headlines. \r\nThink tanks devise phrases and buzz words to stimulate divide and rule or to ridicule and silence anyone who questions the desired direction of social conditioning. Its very clever, because if governments are able to get the public to police themselves, it makes many more controllable and diverts blame that should be aimed at control systems, onto each other. I would not say its hate speech, but it can turn into veiled censorship and hatred of those who question stuff, with good reason. \r\nI think this presentation by Rowan Atkinson on free speech, is very good and outlines the psychology of manipulation of a self policing society. Particularly this statement he makes on how things are becoming:... 'You may call the new intolerance, a new but intense desire to gag uncomfortable voices of dissent'. 'I am not intolerant', say many people, say softly-spoken highly educated liberal-minded people: 'I am only intolerant of intolerance' and people tend to nod sagely and say', and yet if you think about it this supposedly inarguable statement for a longer than 5 seconds, you realise that all it is advocating is the replacement of one kind of intolerance with another. Which to me doesn't represent any kind of progress at all. Underlying prejudices, injustice or resentments are not addressed by arresting people. They are addressed by the issues being aired, argued and dealt with preferably outside the legal process. For me the best way to increase societies resistance to insulting or offensive speech is to allow a lot more of it. As with childhood diseases, you can better resist those germs to which you have been exposed. We need to build up our immunity to taking offence, so that we can deal with the issues that perfectly justifies criticism raised. Our priority should be to deal with it the message, not the messenger.' \r\nRowan Atkinson is a very clever individuate and humor is a good way to communicate. Maybe all the chaos and restrictions happening right now, is like As Above, So Below. Maybe the evolution of humanity happens after all the shit to float to the top and to sort it out.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Vital Media 11.11.11", "channel": "UC8QIpf2FRn8W69jlQS4oPcQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj51-V9xYxOaNVupqzXdP10hYJmw4hjzOf-_aV6Rw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For the whole world, not just white ppl and Christians.  You are the victim in all of this than, only You are not aware and ppl like You. Time of \"owning my own bussiness and all gonna be fine\" has passed long ago for Christians and not just them, but all the sane ppl wanting to keep liberty, democracy, culture and all of the essence of identity and freedom, no matter of race, religion or any other kind of diversity. And the way things go now, it looks, sadly, that we all gonna be aware more of it every day, You also. Atack on white ppl and Christians comes from the fact that they are beacon in democracy, not saying some others are not too. If they break that, than the humanity is on its knees for totaliarian fascists. Thats why they divided society in the USA and elsewhere for that purpose and all the \"woke campaigne\", behind which stands grotesque fact and truth how non-white haters (also whites) produced lately are  used, fooled  and manipulated in it, many of them are already aware of it, who were DELUSIONAL for real. Thats why all this cancel culture and madness  and insanity we are seeing every day now.

Its the man to be admired and found out what he talks. Thats the kind of ppl who should be listened  in this  oppressive times! To break delusions THEY put on ppl and we  all know who THEY are, from Bill Gates(\"let them it  bugs\"), to George Soros (real NAZI  from WWII), Coca Cola and others in the \"club\". When super rich ppl take almost all of  the wealth and make promisses to  others of equality with some false marxists agenda, covering pure  FASCISM under it (corporates becoming goverment and  state power, instead ppl and democracy), one is to  ask himself than, especially those  fools who fell on their tricks and promisses. How THEY think: \"We gonna make You all equal - equaly poor, while we gonna stay utterly rich (thats the kind of bizarre \"eqaulity\" they preach to fools to vote and follow them). We need to do that, but we have greatest obstacle - white ppl and Christians, cause they are most educated and democratic, they are most resiliant to it than (Coca Cola - be less white for employees, needless to say anything?!). We need to bring them down and weaken them, by turning fooled  others against them and making them minority, than we can easily do  whatever we like with all that mass, once to  be democratic world\".

Insults are deliberate and by definition offensive whereas the right to voice an opinion that someone else finds ofensive is not insulting by definition and therefore should be allowed.  I've seen downright nasty bastards behaving in an obnoxious way by going up to total strangers and spewing horrendous verbal abuse at them in a manner which is intimidating because of the nature of the insults and which would be certain to cause a breach of the peace (by inciting a fight) with some people (the type who can take action to stop such insulting behaviour).  Who in their right mind wants such behaviour to be legal?  This seems to be a type of behaviour that the likes of Rowan Atkinson here have overlooked.  Perhaps they don't know that such things happen.  Regardless, it shouldn't be allowed and no civilised nation would allow such a thing.\n\nNow as it happens such behaviour isn't legal BUT only if someone is offended by it (unless a police officer happens to take the view that a breach of the peace is occurring or is likely to occur).  However, this debate that is currently taking place is clouding this fact and is likely to be misinterpreted by idiots everywhere as meaning that it's perfectly fine to insult anyone.  Another example is the obviously racist person hurling racist insults e.g. at a football match.  Is that acceptable?  Of course it isn't.\n\nNo, the danger here is the idiots who don't understand the difference between controversial opinions and deliberate insults - and these idiots exist on both sides.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Keldor D'Antrell", "channel": "UCLZvBOHhuynfK05ihdYJ2iA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnha6kbrXx2eqkG7GQFpPS3g_GZ0pENQ1HLpYA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Indeed, to even suggest such a thing in opposition to my statement is beyond ridiculous and suggests that you are a part of this communication problem i.e. you struggle to recognise the difference between that which is INHERENTLY insulting - and intended to be so - and that which is merely an opinion in a debate.\n\nNote that the in a debate part is important i.e. it would be easy for a dispicable person (and there are plenty of them about) to deliberately attempt to cause the same trouble caused by being openly insulting by 'simply and innocently expressing an opinion' e.g. loudly expressing the opinion that people of colour should 'go back to Africa' within earshot of a group of African Americans.  That would be inexcusable and (to those of us who are capable of seeing it for what it is i.e. a phoney pretence at expressing an opinion with the ulterior intention of causing insult ) would be dealt with as a breach of the law.\n\nGiven your final sentence, I shall now ignore you because you are either trolling me (which is a the pastime of an imbecile) or so dimwitted as to be beyond education (and you would be advised to get stay out of discussions) i.e. I did not argue that offense taken is a good standard for criminality.

{"cid": "Ugxv6llibhNCAMvMwGx4AaABAg", "text": "Overly simplistic. Some speech is obviously not free. Libel laws and public safety laws are clear evidence of that. The question is therefor not whether all speech is free, but what to allow and what not to allow. \nHowever, 9 years on from this speech we are all too aware of the danger of letting conspiracy theories and fake news go unchallenged. Banning this speech entirely is not only impossible but self-defeating, as it becomes harder to counter the narrative, allowing it to fester. But letting it run free increases the problem of bigotry and racism, and can create deep political problems like Trumpism or brexit. It can even undermine basic scientific research and sensible healthcare policy. \nA \"more robust\" debate doesn't help unless we can agree on the terms of the debate. In general, when unfounded and even clearly non-factual arguments are allowed to be used, the debate actually makes things worse. Where arguments touch on subjective and emotional matters (like gender identification or perceptions of sovereignty), different terms may need to apply, but those have to be set out very clearly and enforced. \nAnd that does actually mean that the state has to set the rules and enforce them to make public debate productive, just like the state has to set the rules and enforce them to make free markets productive.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Dirk Lac", "channel": "UClvEtQ1VRo_S6_JzPvuJ7Ow", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjPjV5qRgEE8cjg0cOyWTlm7_I5xkr7WfBtRg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Maybe that's a misunderstanding on my part. But, my point is it's not a contradiction, because free speech, for better or worse, allows people to lie, and even those that oppose free speech don't argue that the 'truth' should be a pre-requisite of speech or opinion. (In fact, usually the opposite. Try speaking the truth about Tiananmen Square in China). So free speech means you can say whatever lies you want without censorship, but it doesn't mean you can't be called out for it. Or sued. I support free speech, but that doesn't mean I have to believe everything that's said, or accept being defamed.\n\nYou say free speech will be the death of democracy, but how can you have true democracy without free speech and a free press? As much as I hate all this misinformation and blatant lying on behalf of politicians and the media, silencing their voices will not fix the underlying problems. The fact that many Trump supporters simply refuse to believe demonstrable facts shows (if nothing else) their strength of feeling - you can't just squash that with censorship.

{"cid": "UgxH7B7757mtwIwDIpd4AaABAg", "text": "Below is the ULTIMATE article on how to FIGHT BACK against the election fraud \nand attempted Marxist takeover of the USA.  It contains The Plan that will fix this problem once and for all!\n\n\nEverything You Need To Know To Survive a Biden Presidency, Reverse The Election Fraud and Prosper In The Coming Years\n\n\nBy J Galt\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany of us are so white-hot with rage at the blatant and unprecedented fraud\n surrounding the 2020 Presidential election that we can barely speak! And\n the corruption is much worse than even the most cynical among us ever \nsuspected. We all knew that the upper echelon of the FBI had turned into\n a den of thieves some time ago and that many of the Obama-appointed \njudges were just political hacks in black robes.\n\n\n But what has been revealed to us during this once-in-a-lifetime election theft is that \nthere are MANY agencies and quite a few large corporations\nthat have become little more than corrupted arms of the Deep State.\n\n\nAnd I can assure you that using the term “Deep State” does not make anyone a\n crazed conspiracy theorist. By “Deep State” I simply refer to\nentrenched and corrupt bureaucracies (both governmental and corporate) that are in\n place to perpetuate THEIR interests and those of a few\npolitical elites, not those of the American people. And more often than not, their\n interests are at the EXPENSE of and directly opposed to the\ninterests of the American people.\n\n\nWe all knew that there was systemic corruption in government. But at least\n we’ve always had the comfort of knowing that, if nothing else,  we \ncould  elect our president, senators and other representatives. Now, \neven that illusion has been shattered.  Our votes now appear to mean \nnothing.\n\n\nAs one of the most murderous dictators in history, Joseph\n Stalin reportedly said…..and remember this well:  “Those who cast the \nvotes decide nothing. Those who COUNT the votes decide everything.”  We never\n thought that this truism would come home to roost in the US.\n\n\nHow wrong we were.\n\n\nIf you’re willing to invest the time to read this entire article, you are \ngoing to learn some things that you may find astounding. A lot of\napparently unrelated loose ends will be tied together. A lot of what’s been \nhappening in the last few years that may have seemed inexplicable\nto you will start to make sense. With that in mind, I urge you to stick \nwith this…..I can guarantee you that some of the things you will read in\nthe pages that follow you won’t have seen anywhere else.\n\n\nYou’ll spend a few hours watching an NFL game,  even though many of the \nplayers  have shown through recent statements and actions that they have\n nothing but scorn for you and your values. Hopefully you’re willing to \nmake the same investment of time to learn some critical information that\n will help you save your country and loved ones.\n\n\nAmong the many things on which we’ll  be shining the light  in the following pages are:\n\n\n* How the election fraud took place and EXACTLY how we can reverse it, even though Biden is now in office.\n\n\n* With Biden in office, should you own stocks, or sell every stock you own right now?\n\n\n* Q-anon. Is it real, or a hoax? Should you take it seriously? You may be surprised.\n\n\n What we can learn from 16th century England that shows us why you may \nnot be able to trust the police to be patriots when you need them  the \nmost.\n\n\n* Gun confiscation. Why is the Left so desperate to disarm America? What you can do about it.\n\n\n*  How you can vastly reduce your personal risk if we have a financial or societal collapse.\n\n\n  How you can inflict financial revenge on the people and entities \nresponsible for this election fraud. The exact things you can do.\n\n\n Which companies you must never patronize again if you are a patriot. \nThese companies contribute to the very people trying to destroy your\nfreedom.\n\n\n*  The best and worst places to live as far as financial and personal safety.\n\n\n*  Which banks you should avoid doing business with at all costs.\n\n\n*  Why you should almost certainly move your IRA/401k/pension away from where you now have it.\n\n\n*  What you never knew about bank safety deposit boxes and home safes, and why you should never have either one.\n\n\n*  The exact steps you need to take if you want to avoid future elections being stolen.\n\n\n* The one thing you must do, even if you do nothing else on this list, if you want to win this war and restore freedom.\n\n\n  How the Russians are partly responsible for the current poor quality \nof modern university education, and what you can do about it.\n\n\n The lessons we can learn from the collapse of the Roman Empire that explain\n why there are some US states you must leave, no matter what.\n\n\n* Things about Covid that will shock you. Why is it that most of the states enforcing severe lockdowns are Democratic states?\n\n\n* Where you can earn 10x to even 20x the interest that a bank will pay you with very, very little risk.\n\n\n* Bitcoin. Should you own it,  or are there good reasons to avoid it?\n\n\n* The single worst investment to make during a Biden presidency, despite it having a reputation as being completely safe.\n\n\nThis may seem like a lot to ask from one article, but come back to this list\n after you’ve finished reading the entire article. I promise you that\nyou’ll know the answer to every single point listed above.\n\n\nOne thing I can guarantee you: it will be a journey like none other.  Some \nof the information in this article will shock you, but you need to know it.\n\n\nAnd by the way, everything below is free of charge. There is no link \nasking for money anywhere in this article. It is one patriot’s gift to\nanother. I don’t want money, gratitude or anything else, other than that you \nread what follows and act on the advice given.  If everyone who\nreads this entire article does that, we’ll get our country back.\n\n\nAnd  with that……we begin…….\n\n\nI have bad news for you.\n\nDuring the last few years, while you were watching football games, looking \nafter your family and just getting on with the business of having a\nproductive life…..a war was started against the US. It’s the worst kind of war, \nbecause the enemy isn’t readily apparent. There were no planes\ndropping bombs on our cities, or boats landing on the beaches disgorging foreign troops onto US soil.\n\n\nNo…….it’s a much worse kind of war than that.  We have been attacked by people \nfrom WITHIN our country. Yes, it’s true that they have recently had \nconsiderable help from  China and a few other foreign adversaries. But \nthe “Ground Troops” are almost all Americans. It does little good to \nbuild a mighty fortress  when your own people turn on you and attack you\n from inside the walls.  And yet, that is precisely what has happened to\n the US.\n\nThe question is……do you care enough to fight back as hard as will be required to WIN this war?\n\nThis is all the room that the forum  will allow in a post. If you drop me an\n email at paulrevere2021@protonmail.com I will send you the entire\narticle. It's a complete game changer and EVERY patriot should read it.\n\n\nGod Bless\nJ Galt", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Don Gilliam", "channel": "UCnBGsplXhnuQ25gE8tQAYSQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniIwGsOWCqyJMlcCv4L96p5jHax5TZa6Jpalw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Disrespect stems from ignorance, which we can resolve as humans through education and informing. I agree that aggressiveness is not a solution, but this is something that is part of our nature. Our emotions is something we need to control through nurturing and education. Why suppress negative emotions when we can learn to control it, rather than diminish it. Of course creating a respectful society does not happen over night, but neither does removing political correctness. Which is besides the point. Good things are hard to implement in our societies, especially when we can easily find that our societies' are built upon corruption and ignorance. Of course it will be hard to change. I believe telling what people should and should not feel is just as bad as not having any free speech at all. Why is suppressing our emotions more valued than suppressing our speech? Does not make sense to me. If we are able to educate each other and inform each other from early ages - on the importance of respect, similar to how Japan implement this in their education systems. We essentially build a society with a foundation of respect. This way, we can address issues of disrespect calmly, whether it's cultural, religion or racism through education. That's how life is; we can give respect, but not guaranteed it back, same concept applies to kindness, effort, love, money. It does not mean we should not incorporate it within our lives. As cringy as it may sound, the world needs more love, respect, peace and unity.

Don't get me wrong, respectful speech is a good thing to strive for, but it needs to to come gradually and start somewhere first. \n\nIf I could snap my fingers and have everyone be respectful to each other, then I would, but then again that would depend on what I consider respectful and disrespectful. \n\nNot to mention there are some cultures that consider some words or phrases bad, while others aren't bothered by those same words. \n\nIgnorance will always exist, but reacting aggressively to it gets us nowhere and we can't impose our will on them to become respectful because that isn't right either. Plus respect goes both ways: we can give respect, but we're not guaranteed it in return, so that leaves us with the response to being disrespected, and how we react to that will determine whether the cycle of disrespect continues.\n\nBuilding a society based on respectful speech doesn't happen overnight, it needs to begin with ourselves. It's like you said \"balance is key\", but what I'm saying is that in order to get to that balance we have to achieve it ourselves. \n\nThat's why I suggest that people learn to ignore negative things or at least take a step back to assess the situations they're in.

What is the purpose of hate speech, negative speech? Humans are capable of criticising something without blatantly being disrespectful. Why build a society where everyone can disrespect everyone and what is the value in that? All in the name of \"free speech\"? Constructive cristism is different from hate speech. One has a purpose, the other does not. One is good for society, the other is not. To say one should be expected to \"go about their day\" after racist comments are thrown at you will lead to chaos and division. You might as well supress human emotions as human emotions will always be there, and no matter how much understanding one has and how much one \"suppresses\" their emotions - there will always be something that a human being will highly value and if that is threatened in any way, they will feel emotions. You might as well start killing people if morality, respect and emotions are thrown out of society in the name of free speech. All for what exactly?\n\nWhat value can Total Free Speech provide society that Respectful Free Speech can't? Disrespect stems from ignorance. Ignorance can be fixed with education.\n\nThe answer is to simply build a society that allows free speech based on respect. Let the difference sink in and you will understand how valuable and different this is. This provides society more value than the current \"political correctness\" we see in western societies.\nBalance is key. People are quick to point and label free speech based on respect or similar idealogies as \"dictatorship\" which is also ignorance.\nI personally do not see the value in \"Total\" free speech, compared to value and potential of \"Respectful\" free speech.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "bejbejbej1", "channel": "UCmA9UEdr5hjh_k9wOz5EgVg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnh7CeCf8P-kmRuZVTlJuL6zHDwtMGUq7bR897A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgzjVawee0qlzOgrA0t4AaABAg.9JNr0FVLfap9JR1JwqCro7", "text": "Well you see, that's where building up a resistance to these offenses come in. If people learn to not get offended by these kind of insults, then the words themselves have no power. This means that people can shrug them off and go on about their day. Just think about the internet trolls that try to annoy people and get reactions from them, but if people ignore those same trolls, they go on a little bit longer before getting bored and finding someone else to bother. \n\nNow let me try to answer you questions as best as I can.\n\nFor the free speech question: Yes we should be allowed to say whatever we want and whenever we want, even if its offensive or unpopular. That way people can make the choice to either A: Confront said person with remarks with their own remarks, or if a statement, then argue/debate said statement. B: Just ignore the person in question and walk away, after all we can't force them to change their opinions, and besides they just make it easier for people to avoid them and spent their time better elsewhere.\n\nFor the \"N\" word in the black community question: They could just ignore the guy/lady calling them that word. There's always gonna be people like that so no sense in getting angry and  wasting time on them. \n\nFinally for your questions on where to draw the line: I believe that there should be no line drawn, because negative free speech only holds as much value as we give it, but if we choose not to get angry about it and discuss what is being said then we can have a better understanding of each other and perhaps understand why the negative speech was said, unless its an insult, then ignoring it is fine. Anyway, suppressing that negative free speech, on the other hand only causes those kind of people to vent their frustrations through other means, and given the two choices, I'd rather they be mean with their words.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot control what other people say and act, but we can control how we respond and react given the circumstances. Anyway hope that my answer was sufficient, unless you weren't expecting a serious answer, still these are good questions that should be asked and I'm glad we have people like you asking them.

The nazis specifically banned speech they deemed to be incorrect, or politically offensive, just like you would love to do. Ban all \"incorrect\" speech.

It is the ability to express whatever you want without the government being able to dictate what you can and cannot say. Scientific discoveries were made precisely because someone once went against what was known to be true and presented an idea which might've been considered false and ridiculous. Like heliocentrism. The church considered that to be false and thus banned it. \n\nBanning \"factually incorrect\" speech would very rapidly devolve into banning all speech the government deems to be incorrect and thus tyranny would inevitably ensue. \n\nWhen an idiotic idea gets expressed, like for example, the flat earth conspiracy, or racism, the best course of action is to present counter arguments and show the world why those ideas are incorrect and not based of facts. This demonstrates that you are open for debate and questioning, and it's an educational exercise for everyone. \n\nNow lets compare this form of open discourse with your tyrannical ideology. In your fantasy world, what would happen is this: Someone expresses their belief in the flat earth, or whatever other nonsense. They then get arrested and silenced immediately.  People witness this happening. They begin to question why their beliefs would warrant such a reaction. What if they're correct? After all it's not like you can even see their arguments anymore. More and more people begin to get arrested or fined and silenced after making factual errors of any sort. Eventually a genius inventor somewhere comes up with a revolutionary discovery that has the ability to change the world, but is silenced because his ideas aren't in line with current knowledge. Eventually you yourself accidentally slip up, forget to check your sources, and make a factual error. Bam, arrested, and silenced. Fast forward a few hundred years, and you've now got a system running on outdated incorrect facts, and a massive revolution on your hands, filled with people that have been radicalised and believe that the silenced flat earthers and racists were right all along, because there's no discourse or way of hearing their arguments, so hey, they might just be right. Why should they trust their government if they can't even hear the other side after all? Cut out a mans tongue and all you prove is that you are scared of what he has to say because you know it is true, as the saying goes. And just like that you've got a garbage, dystopian, collapsing society where all new controversial ideas with a possibility of being incorrect and shut down and a slippery slope effect where outlawing speech knows no bounds. \n\nScience THRIVES on contradicting ideas, new ideas, and opposition. Without opposition and questioning, science is no different from religion. Science needs to be questioning in order to progress and to stay accurate. For every 1000 people that the flat earth conspiracy deceives, it helps 100,000 more educate themselves on astronomy and mathematics. For every 1000 people that anti vaxxers deceive, it helps 100,000 more learn how vaccines truly work and why they should trust them. For every 1000 people that become racist, 100,000 more can use the flaws in the opposition's arguments to become anti racists. \n\nI'm hoping you're just naive and you don't really hold such an evil ideology though. But even if you do, that is your right of free speech.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Average Alien", "channel": "UCFNDfENexEE5dXYNAABNTSA", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniAeZENi2QO2gQfSGmbP4Ue-FohKK2j1yALd6s2vA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(ie earth is flat) There's not a single living soul with a brain which is normally functioning that can agree that racism is a good thing, and that it should be spread. The less means you give to an ideology to spread the less it will spread. Pretty sure that if the German Government in place before WW2 would've put in place a censorship and arrest of Nazi ideology, we would've dodge a war. Pretty hard to indoctrinate mass of people if you can't even disperse your ideology.\n\n I should've been more precise in my first comment about ''lies and nonsense''. Life would be much easier if lies/nonsense was banned from society. There's a reason why science exists and why it has to fight constantly against waves of retardation that don't want to acknowledge it. (anti vaxx, flat earth believers)\n\nAlso, thanks for pointing out the ''there's no hate speech'' American argument. I literally detailed what ''Hate Speech'' contains which is: Racism, Inciting Violence, and Harassment. You can say what you will, but the modern societies work with it. There's a definition to it, there's regulation on which it defines itself. Claiming otherwise is like claiming Earth is flat.\n\nHate speech ≠ I don't like what someone says.

(Most Americans let's be honest are zealots and fanatics when it comes to their constitution and amendments, dare you not talk about their free speech/guns or you shall suffer an eternity of babling about their individualism and how their standards of life are superior.)  We use some minor forms of censoring over full free speech in Canada. And to me, it leads to less racism, less dumbasses going around spewing lies and nonsense. Less fanaticism and hatred by itself. Judging by a difference between countries that use some sort of minor censorship vs free speech (US vs UK, Canada, Australia and others)  I can say that using the hate speech concept is practical and efficient. \n(Might have actually another correlation as to why racial tensions, hatred and bigotry is so prevalent in the current American society though, as we can see with how much gun violence there is vs another country that has gun rights like Switzerland. Mentalities and education priorities?)\n\nThere's a difference between being critical, disagreeing or not liking what someone says, and it doesn't become hate speech until it ticks off one of the 3 criteria above.

Now what makes anyone pick one over the other? I can tell you my own reasons and you are free to argue otherwise.\nMy reason: 1-) is it possible that she forgot when she exactly married?\n2-) that very same wife mentions multiple times and on multiple occasions that she is \"the youngest wife the prophet had\" and that she was \"the only virgin wife of the prophet\" and that god has replaced \"the too old wife with a better one\".\nAll these quotes suggest that she thinks being the younger and the virgin is special (this might be due to the culture at the time; plus i am not concerned why she thinks that)\n3-) This second reason suggest she might be biased unto exaggerating how young she was, as this would make her more \"special\" right? \nNow I am no expert in hunan psychology but I have seen some past-wishful thinking where ppl seem to miss remember.\nHumans are fallable afterall and I am not  interested to explain the reason why a false or innacurate account can happen\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into it yourself, I will be glad to provide you with resources I find.

{"cid": "UgxZKLZir6AKrRO4U-V4AaABAg", "text": "The problem I have with the current state of free speech is with the weaponization of \"hate speech\" labels in some of the more heated left vs right matters. Without giving any specific examples, if liberals do not agree with conservatives, they do not argue, they instead label their opponent's views as being hate speech and basically begin bullying campaigns against those who support the conservative or libertarian viewpoint. On some more common issues it almost becomes akin to brainwashing, we're told over and over that something is hate speech we eventually start to just believe it and police ourselves.\n\nI'm trying not to be biased against liberals, but I just can't think of any liberal talking points that are actively touted as being hate speech, there might be some people making noise here and there, but nobody listens. Hate speech suppression is purely the realm of liberals, simple as that, they are effective at gatekeeping free speech by changing definitions and successfully convincing the public that these differences matter when it comes to free expression. They have created a culture of fear amongst ourselves, and it creates a very hostile environment for open discussion.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "TheIrishEnigma", "channel": "UC-dn99Y2hU0mhyaiMoasGYQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhSq1bSezaF5tfSs54is_5Hx_13KOftVDWqaohD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Cultivating that climate of rejection through racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia has coffins-in-the-ground impact through words alone.\n\nYelling Fire in a theatre is one example of a reasonable limit on free speech.

Twisting terms so words can be used as weapons is a core tool in the suppression of freedom of speech. It is the method employed by these new age 'moderators' to intimidate people into silence.\n\nAs in all things it is the intent of the meaning that matters. I understood the reference above about Political Correctness. I think whether you take fascism here to be an analogy for authoritarian suppressive behavior, or an evolution of the word used literally, the difference is irrelevant.\n\nThe truth is, when you set yourself apart to be a position of authority on what people can and can't say, without being elected by a majority, you are in the wrong. That is the basis of dictatorship. So many heinous regimes believed absolutely in what the were doing. So the idea that ones beliefs can justify such action is empty and self deluded. Whether we call this behavior 'fascism' or create a new word is by the by. It has the exact same core ethos of forcing ones view of how humanity should operate on everyone else. Seeking to exert control because you feel divinely and self righteously that you are a superior human being. Willing to go to harsh and extreme lengths to protect your self appointed authority and quell opposition.\n\nThe worrying thing is the belief that this is somehow virtuous. It is always done for the 'greater good', but that is a perspective, and is rarely proven to be the case. Mussolini was probably a true hero in his own eyes. It is definitely something worth considering when self congratulating yourself for your 'heroic' efforts in silencing those pesky voices you don't agree with.

It's quite funny.\n\nF = a regime that goes for one direct philosophy.\nAuthoritarianism which can be in F too, makes this the whole oppressing, etc lalalala. But F itself is just the regime that is going towards something with a disregard of any other opinion. This is why it is sometimes, but wrongly, equated to imperialism.\n\nM = an ideology. You can't deny this. He wrote numerous columns on his philosophy and beliefs. He then wrote extensively against those things he wrote in the late 1800s but every M seem to forget this fact.\nHowever, correct M is not C and is kind of S but isn't at the same time. I call it \"bad socialism\".\n\nC = a regime which has full state control over land, its peoples and their expressions. It's based on commune not individual basically. Some C's believe this to be a good trait of a regime but in practice this always ends up as \"your tribe vs my tribe\" which is just bad for humanity generally.\nThis also has authoritarianism aspect to it, which generally leads to secret police, mass state media, and such.\n\nWhat Euphoria was saying is what you call \"Anarchy\" but a utopic version of that anarchism which typically is from your dreamers. Becuase in reality a stateless society run by people would again just become \"your tribe vs my tribe\" and general chaos. You need certain controls and law in a society, we are not neolithic my fellow human anymore; we have too many people to govern :)\n\nJust want to also point out there are no wings, so saying x = this and y = that is like that saying BBC scotland has a show that the English version doesn't get and therefore the BBC England version is wrong or vice versa. It is all based on your philosophy and your experiences in life. Idealism, here, is what makes it hard to justify right.

If it’s an emergency it would be quicker. If I want one straight away I would have the option of private healthcare and I could pay for it. The reason people travel to the US for healthcare is because they are better for certain treatments but it’s a shame that the people living in the country can’t afford it. It’s amazing to me that you also don’t realise that you would literally be paying less if you had socialised healthcare.\n\nThe Conservative right does not support better opportunities. To go to Uni you need money which discourages people who are raised in poverty. People born to lower income families are discouraged from going to hospital or calling an ambulance simply because it will cost money. \n\nThe difference between the far left and far right is, the far left wants to work as a community, while the far right is individualistic and only thinks about themselves. Which is dangerous and isn’t great for longevity. \n\n(Not sure if this makes a lot of sense, had about 8 beers before I wrote this)", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Euphoria", "channel": "UCwATKJgE0rA7MVF5tSsTMwA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngELlAHaaEYF-lAZNo6ri25P_BUCkWNlAUQmYUo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzIx5Wk3VlCYKyljlh4AaABAg", "text": "Never before has tolerance been as intolerant as it is today. And those who claim to be tolerant the most, are usually the most intolerant. These days, I'm not even sure I want to be considered tolerant anymore. If being tolerant means prosecuting people for voicing their (unpopular) opinion, or cracking a joke someone could potentially find offensive, I think I'll give tolerance a pass. It has lost its value anyway. Tolerance inflation, so to say. The more you seem to hear of it, hear the actual word being spoken, hear people remind you to be more tolerant when, in fact, they themselves are anything but, the less it is worth and nowadays the word is everywhere. And it is worth nothing anymore! \nBesides, one doesn't eliminate intolerance by shutting people up, one just makes people stay silent about it. Just saying. Shutting people up is just a means for some snowflakes to be able to live in their idealistic bubble undisturbed. In the 60ies and 70ies, at least they got stoned in order to do that but didn't force other people to stop saying what they didn't want to hear on a global scale.
