The Bible says: Matt 28:20 Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.” “… a ransom for many.” Is this automatic?? Or, is this better stated as “…a ransom for many who enter through the narrow gate”? Matt 7:13 Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; 14 whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it. --- What is the key? We find it in John 3:36 The one who exercises faith (most Bibles use the word ‘believes’ here) in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him. --- Romans 10:9 For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation. --- “…but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” How? By being obedient to Jesus; See John 3:36 above. What did Jesus command be done? Matt 28:18 Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. 19 Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” --- ALL authority has been given to Jesus, to complete his work in the Holy Name of his (and our) Father; John 5:43; John 10:25. BUT… you can’t glorify Jesus for doing the Will of the Father; John 5:41 I do not accept glory from men. ALL glory belongs to the Father. If you are obeying Jesus, he said he would always be with you. Please ask yourself why did Adam die? Are you doing the work that Jesus commanded to done? If not….. you are disobedient.

{"cid": "UgxMqRGJyJj4i2NCGEN4AaABAg", "text": "Mask/Anti-mask...false argument. Masks were never designed or promoted as a means to reduce/prevent the transmission of viral agents. Masks were designed to prevent droplets and therefore the bacteria in those droplets from entering the body via incisions during surgery (pre-covid, hospital staff, exposed to all manner of ailments from the general public, did not run around in masks all day and somehow they all didn't get sick or die). 30,000-60,000 in the US die from influenza every year; 3000 people per day die from tuberculosis -- if effective, why were masks never mandated? Were these deaths acceptable? One study pointed out that, not only are masks not effective in preventing the spread of viruses, but there was no understanding of whether longterm use would be detrimental and that more research is needed. My position has been: If research eventually shows longterm use to be detrimental, who would be held accountable for having mandated them? The answer is that no one will be held personally liable. Ultimately, any settlements that would be paid would come from taxpayers. Government has no business telling free people what to wear. If the color blue was shown to calm schizophrenics, would we all be forced to wear blue for the public good? If I don't want to wear blue 24-7-365, does it mean I don't care about schizophrenics? It's all nonsense as well as unconstitutional. From a commonsensical perspective, if these measures were effective, why haven't cases declined precipitously?

In addition I must have an acceptable covid quarantine plan and if they dont like it they can send me to a covid quarantine prison. If I just go and get the shot and then try to return with no covid test I will get fined 3500 and get put in covid prison. If you are a truck driver however you can drive back and forth with no covid regulations whatsoever. I drove to the border in advance today to get this information.

That's not how science works, you don't get to disregard all of the information that disagrees with you and point at just the bits that confirm your claim. If you're allowed to do that, climate change deniers can prove that all the science confirms their opinions, for example. The science becomes meaningless. I said it in February of last year: don't require people to wear masks until you have a mask medically proven to be safe and effective for this use case, provided them to everyone, and with significant information about how to properly wear and handle them. Unless you follow that approach, you just end up with a mess and they won't work. That's because I read the studies. I can understand feeling like it's an emergency so we need to quickly get a solution, but that sense of urgency doesn't mean they're going to suddenly do what the science says they won't.\n\nThe reason nobody had anything like this ready is the same reason no country was ready for a pandemic. We just don't have the means to deal with a pandemic. In the future, with RNA vaccine technology, we'll be able to get massive numbers of vaccines out in a hurry, and that can be a valid response coupled with true lockdowns, but not if it takes months. We don't have masks available even today that are medically proven effective against two-way aerosol transmission, and contact tracing is largely infeasible. We just don't have an answer, so let's do the most reasonable thing: make sure mRNA vaccines are safe and be able to pump them out and get ahead of things like this, instead of futilely flailing in the wind hoping to stop a hurricane.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Lambda Function", "channel": "UC-OTun68BklND-pH9eXzORw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngQDS9mb-rBlu80LTmp--SD96teYJcQtzCucw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyDCaLjBcW4TteGntt4AaABAg", "text": "Yo dude you’re getting way too invested in Twitter. Watched you since before the first impeachment, probably under 10k subs. So when I say this, it’s based on my experience watching you for the past few years. \n\nOver the past 6 months or so you’ve been slowly becoming more and more irritable, and it’s always from reading news, and from your own admission, using twitter to vent. And while the news is enraging for everyone, it’s exponentially increased by Twitter. In my opinion, it’s a combination of putting everyone with a low social credit score under “more replies”, and limiting the number of characters you can tweet. What that effectively does is erase the nuances of very complex discussion and instead opts to make opinions as dumbed down, generic, and digestible as possible. TLDR: it’s for stupid people. \n\nMost of us “conservatives” took the step, whether voluntarily or not, to leave the platform. I can say it’s drastically improved my mental well-being. I worry that you’re undergoing the same process that I, and many others experienced; and that can cause real world impact with your family and friends. Don’t let it. \n\nGet your news from other sources, other platforms will just screencap tweets and have their own discussion instead of driving traffic and having to engage. Patriots.win, gab, (NOT Parler), plus Mike Lindell’s new platform is launching this week, Trump’s in May. But funnily enough, probably the best place for news discussion on the internet is 4chan’s /pol/ board. It’s basically the complete opposite of Twitter, but the discussion and news of the day cycles through without the absence of meaningful discussion.\n\n/pol/ takes some getting used to but here’s some quick tips: First, antisemitism is rampant on /pol/, because it’s one big role playing session. It’s regularly promoted by Israelis funnily enough. We know this because your country flag will show, vpns and proxies are banned, so it’s all in good fun. Your first reaction will be to say antisemitism is bad. But you actually want to do the opposite. This is because by default, you must assume everyone on 4chan is either a cop, or a troll and is baiting you, because they are. It’s one big psychological operation, except you’re on your guard by default. That skepticism helps in the interpretation of current events. The world is still burning around you, but you just learn to better deal with it. Don’t ask me why, but /pol/ is ironically one of the best forums of discussion, you just have to filter the trolling, and you learn quickly, almost like a survival instinct. I think taking a break from Twitter would be good for you either way, and there’s healthier options.\n\nThings to look forward to using /pol/ if you do check it out:\n-You will become an expert on World War 2 history, global politics in places today like the UK, Australia, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, etc. This is because you can tell where people are from immediately in most cases, and their opinion holds weight when you can see whose who, as opposed to the fallacy of twitter, where not immediately knowing leads you to automatically assume you’re speaking to someone in the US or Canada, thus giving their opinion more weight. For some reason it’s exactly the opposite on /pol/, you know they’re not your countrymen, but their opinion does provide better perspective.\n\n-How to better handle people and drive the conversation, anywhere on the internet. Often this is done through empirical sources, and memes.\n\n-You will be able to meme. For real now.\n\n-You will be able to better control what deserves your attention, what is a distraction, and what you should be discussing on other platforms that is often entirely overlooked or suppressed.\n\n-You will be able to better identify fake news, and often won’t even have to look at why something is or isn’t true, because it will be immediately provided to you, either in the thread itself as a reply, or ahead of the fake news story itself.\n\n-You will be kept better informed on current events than on Twitter, unless it’s on a local level.\n\n4chan is filled with some of the most highly educated and intellectual people you will ever meet, although it may not seem that way on the surface. Just remember what I said above, and you’ll do fine.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Trump Won", "channel": "UCbIb4r0W-RipC-2Q-PB-r3A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniXWsysiC5GL0ktwhAbfISCsjskBsAlr8EysQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nurses etc..  were given face masks that had such powerful smells of chemicals they got headaches, face rashes and one even told me her chest hurt and she felt dizzy. Even tho people complained, they were ignored and told to wear them anyway, they used creams on their faces to treat the sores and as a barrier to the chemicals. \nNOW WHAT THE **LL WAS IN THOSE MASKS THAT PEOPLE WORE FOR HOURS A DAY AND WEEKS IN TOTAL?!! WHAT DID THEY BREATH IN THEIR LUNGS ALL THAT TIME AND WILL THERE BE SOME FUTURE ISSUE THAT COMES FROM IT.?\n\nNurses fought for the right in COURTS to NOT wear masks bc they dont work on viruses and were hard on breathing/lungs. THEY WON. Now 6 years later they are fighting AGAINST US NOT WANTING TO WEAR THEM. Make sense of that one will you? \n\nDr Deena Hinshaw of Alberta Public Health totally ignored the letter from the 27 year PPE EXPERT who normally advises AHS, the military.  energy industry... on their PPE needs and information when he said UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THEY BE WORN OR FORCED ON PEOPLE!! He said they do not work and they cause all kinds of issues from BREATHING IN PARTICULATES, to causing bacterial infections and a host of other things he PROVED to her in a follow up video when she ignored him. \n\nSHOULD WE BE ABLE TO SUE THE GOV AFTER THEY KNEW POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND FORCED US ANYWAYS?!\n\nSTOP FORCING US!!!

Ivermectin is a anti parasitic with powerful anti viral properties. From the past year the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance has been trying to get the message out about Ivermectin. In the FLCCC Weekly Update youtube mentions how Mexico switched over to Ivermectin in late December, 2020 make it available without prescription ( over the counter) then saw hospitalization and deaths reduce over 80% as a result. Ivermectin costs three cents a tablet, two tablets administer as follows; 1st tablet on day one, 2nd on day three. This kills the virus. Then to maintain protection just 1 tablet a week. So to be virus free for a year costs $1.65 Not providing access or treatment to a covid19 victim is murder as this cure has been know for the past year but is being blocked because it is a financial threat to vaccine producers.

Such PFC chemicals wouldn't be uncommon on a backpack or a rain jacket, and they normally wouldn't be near your mouth or nose where you might inhale them as they rub off the fibers, so the generally safe standard is perfectly fine in the context of a backpack or jacket.

They are out there under disguise to purposefully make it feel like they aren’t involved.  The whole purpose of them is to force the issue, to give bad answers, to see what the only person for whom is actually being monitored will do.  Will that individual go along with the group think even though it is obvious their wrong or will they speak up, effectively going against the grain.  Conclusion, a large majority goes along to get along.  So it is the exact opposite of what you’d like to happen.\nAs stated, most think there would be now way as a regular citizen who found themselves in the past that they’d ever go along to get along with the status quo.  The evidence doesn’t bare this out.\nThe folks that drove and managed the trains to extermination camps could not have all been utterly disdainful people.  Years earlier these were everyday people, just trying live a life and do their job.  So what transpired that allowed them to participate in such acts of human atrocity?  And why do most think they’d be the odd man out who risks it all to speak up and say this is horrible and I’m not gonna do it?\nThe status quo is powerful and most reason away their actions in relation to their deeds.\nThe health authority folks that went to that restaurant easily reason away their tyranny enforcement actions.  Failing to recognize that these folks have a vested interest in reasoning their acts away or outright denying they have any free will in the matter or that they aren’t doing anything immoral and placing your trust to hope is only seceding the battle.  \nBy far the vast majority will be the status quo.  I accept that.  I have not lost hope myself that simply because the status quo is unlikely to budge that the battle is lost.  It is not.\nI don’t need to convince everyone in the status quo that making pot illegal is wrong on so many levels.  The seeds of its own destruction are down into the action itself.  It’s a failure and won’t last.  Today, now that pot is legal many of those that were the status quo would readily tell you they think it’s fine.  Worse, they forget they believed otherwise earlier, that they were the resistance.  I don’t need to get everyone to agree on all points in order to drag them along kicking and screaming.  I am an optimist, cause the absurdity of their actions will ultimately fail on its own.  I just don’t care to wait for the edifice to come crashing down but instead desire to tear it down, on their heads of need be.  Equally I am a realist.  Meaning, I don’t give into to rosy, make me feel better platitudes about hope and one day the rest will see the light.  Perhaps some, but history and evidence suggests most won’t.

I am saying to believe that the overwhelming number of NPC’s are unlikely to ever come about unless they are forced to or are dragged kicking and screaming.\nThe cultist’s, the emotional reasoners, are not the type that change their tune so readily.  \nEveryone thinks if they were transported back in time, say to Germany, there is no way they’d given into the group think and status quo of the time, fascism.  Most of these people are naive.  \nThe status quo provides so much and that is why it is a limited small fraction of people who actually speak out.  You highlighting this small group does not an argument make that others will follow in large numbers.\nThose that speak up are labelled as fringe, COVID idiots, conspiracists, selfish, etc.\nLook it there are ample psychological experiments which bare this out.  A classic is the one that examines an individual amongst a crowd and whether or not that individual will speak what they know is truth but which simultaneously goes against the group.  Here’s three circles, which one is larger .... clearly the answer is A, but the group all says B.  Everyone likes to think they’d hold fast to their principles and risk standing out against the crowd.  In reality, it’s a unique individual that actually does so.\nLong story short ... most folks do a cost benefit analysis and conclude, the risk is not worth the gain.  Perhaps when the risk of not speaking up becomes so grave these same people may be willing to take the risk.  Very often the ship has sailed at that point.  Meaning, the effective and appropriate time to have spoken up is past.  \nTake cancel culture.  Many are silent even many may feel something about it doesn’t sit well.  Yet the time to speak up is present.  However, the day the cancel culture hits home, say a daughter loses her job for dubious reasons, is when they finally have the risk / reward equation in their favour but by now it’s too late.  The damage is done.\nHaving said all that, I do acknowledge and agree with your original post.  Thank goodness there are those brave enough and principled enough that do speak truth to power and there are many that are in agreement with them even though they may not be in a reasonable position to speak up themselves.  But I don’t think it’s useful nor realistic to hold the view that so long as enough time is given, don’t worry, the rest will eventually see the light.  \nWhether or not these folks ever see the light the idea should be the rest of us are not waiting, hoping, the fight to speak truth to power will forage ahead with or without those others.

Why do you think that “pandemic” should be anonymous to a matter of actual Martial Law & a sign of the end times ? That’s just not how mature scientists defined the term, and that’s how it’s always been... \n\nTo compare, according to this April 2009 article (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634693/) , which focused on only 14 European countries, or 75% of its population, the worst example of a “pandemic” (for which we’ve define the term as such, btw) that hit the Contemporary Era and gave us reliable enough stats, the Spanish Flu, has had an ESTIMATED 2.64 million “excess” deaths in Europe alone for the whole pandemic. \n\n”Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed [and the expected] numbers of deaths in specific time periods” (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm)\n\nSo already, we can tell that the COVID-19 is already in the same league and ballpark as the Spanish Flu it-fucking-self in terms of danger (It has a current REPORTED death toll of 2.85M worldwide, and the stats are still growing, though I’m trying not to sound like a fear-monger or anything) \n\nAnother study (https://www.biospace.com/article/compare-1918-spanish-influenza-pandemic-versus-covid-19/) estimates that the total death toll of the Spanish Flu was in the low dozens of millions, like between 10M or 20M; okay ? \n\nAnd, btw, the fact that Earth is now ~5x as more populous then in 1900 (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population) , & with Europe ~3x bigger than during that time (Oh, and, btw, the death toll of Europe was estimated to be about ~1.1% in that study from before about the estimated death toll of Europe ! ; p) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19453486/) then this most probably means (in and of itself, for some reason or another that I won’t speculate on, as that’s besides the point), that we’ve done a damn better job this time around & on average at controlling this virus so far. \n\nAnd all of this about the Spanish Flu is the absolute worst, and the benchmark for all other pandemics, like this yet incomplete & evolving (in more ways than one) virus\n\nSo if we can do smth about the virus, I say we fucking do !!!", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Nicholas Leclerc", "channel": "UCDCxoOJ0Y8rslWUHreeWP4A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni8UaFySkU1suWyIBKWWTp_aFOdap6CBEpfxQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
